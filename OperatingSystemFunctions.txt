Operating Systems manage programs.
The multitasking OS allows two or more programs or apps to reside in memory at once
When multiple programs or apps are running, one is in the foreground and others are in the background.
The one in the foreground is the current active program and will typically be displayed on the screen.
Another function of an Operating System is coordinating tasks.
The OS determines the order in which tasks are processed by the processor.
These tasks include receiving data from an input device, processing instructions, sending info to an output device and transferring items between memory and storage.
While waiting for devices to be idle, the OS commits items to buffers in memory. Once the device becomes idle, the OS will then transer the item or instruction to the device.
